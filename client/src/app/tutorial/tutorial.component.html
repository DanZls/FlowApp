              FlowApp implements a mathematical algorithm of hydrodynamics for calculating fluid dynamics around solid 
              boundaries.
            </p>
            <p class="p-justified">
              The model represents view from above on a rectangular area of a hypothetical unbounded in any direction pool, 
              filled with fluid (e.g. ocean), which is considered as ideal fluid. Static boundaries are borders of immovable 
              solid objects (e.g. islands). Dynamic boundaries are borders of a shape, formed by liquid, lighter than the main 
              one and floating on surface of the pool (e.g. an oil spill on water); this shape can move freely with the 
              underlying masses of the main liquid, moved by current.

              In the opened window, click on the board to add points to the static boundary. Then click "Next" and add points 
              to the dynamic boundary. Currently, FlowApp allows to add only one static and one dynamic borders to each model.
            </p>
            <p class="p-justified">
              The points should be added in clockwise order around the boundary. Both boundaries should contain at least
              3 points each and be closed. You should not worry about closing a boundary though, since it is closed
              automatically when 3 points are added.

              Avoid building such models, where a dynamic boundary flows around a static one on both sides. This case
              is currently one of the weak spots of the calculating algorithm where it becomes unstable.

              Before you submit the model for calculation, fill the parameters. You can also leave the default ones, which
              are balanced for optimal accuracy and performance.

            <p class="p-justified">
              The parameters are: Flow Velocity - the velocity of current in vector form (default is from left to right); 
              Simulation Time and Simulation Time Step - time parameters, the product of their values gives the number 
              of animation frames generated (default gives 500 frames); Min Points Spacing and Max Points Spacing - minimal 
              and maximum distances between points of boundaries (less is more accurate, but cuts into performance).

            <p class="p-justified">
              Click on "Calculate and Save" button. The calculation will take some time (timeout 30s). After this, the model
              list will reload with the calculated model included. If the calculation times out, the new model will included
              less frames than it should.

              If any problems or failures occure during the calculation or other server-side operations, they will be 
              reflected in "Logs" along with success messages.
