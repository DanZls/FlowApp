# FlowApp
Web project implementing a mathematical algorithm of hydrodynamics for calculating fluid dynamics around solid boundaries.

Also running as a containerized version on Google Cloud Run, available on https://flow-app-client-cbxodu5vga-uc.a.run.app (wait 30-40 seconds until the containers wake up and model list is loaded).

The model represents view from above on a rectangular area of a hypothetical unbounded in any direction pool, filled with fluid (e.g. ocean), which is considered as ideal fluid. Static boundaries are borders of immovable solid objects (e.g. islands). Dynamic boundaries are borders of a shape, formed by liquid, lighter than the main one and floating on surface of the pool (e.g. an oil spill on water); this shape can move freely with the underlying masses of the main liquid, moved by current.

Theoretical description, justification and usage examples for the used simulation method can be found in following publications:
